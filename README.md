**Tyler Myracle**
==================

Hi there, I'm Tyler -- a product manager currently working and living in San Francisco. Most recently I worked at Samsara where I led a new product in the manufacturing space. Prior to Samsara I was the Head of Product and also a GM at RigUp in Austin, TX.   
  
  
**TL;DR**
---------

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 projects: a quick checkout system proof of concept and a suite of tools for managers. I typically use the following stack in my side projects:
  * Node/Express
  * React
  * Ant Design or SemanticUI for component library
  * Postgres
  * Docker
  * Stripe for card processing if needed
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building early stage products, finding product-market-channel fit, or anything at all!
