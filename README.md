**Tyler Myracle**
==================

Hi there, I'm Tyler -- a product manager currently working on Messenger privacy at Facebook. Before that I worked at Samsara where I led a new product in the manufacturing space. Prior to Samsara I was the Head of Product and also a GM at RigUp in Austin, TX.   
  
  
**TL;DR**
---------

- ðŸ”¨ Iâ€™m always tinkering around with different projects and technologies.
- ðŸ˜… My code is usually just good enough to run... I'd never make it as an actual software engineer
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building early stage products, privacy, finding product-market-channel fit, or anything at all!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I'm on twitter [@tylermyracle](https://www.twitter.com/tylermyracle)
