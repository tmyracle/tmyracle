**Tyler Myracle**
==================

Hi there, I'm Tyler -- a PM at Meta currently working on end-to-end encryption for Messenger and Instagram Direct. Before joining Meta I worked at Samsara where I led a new product in the manufacturing space. Prior to Samsara I was the founding Head of Product and also a GM at Workrise - a $3B workforce marketplace for industrial verticals.  

In my spare time I've been sharpening my engineering skills through studying data structures and algorithms and building personal projects.
Projects I've built include:
- A [vendor management system](https://github.com/tmyracle/vendor-management) to track compliance documents (Rails / React / Postgres)
- An [iOS app](https://github.com/tmyracle/dinghy) written in Swift and built on top of the OpenSea API to browse NFTs
- A web3 proof of concept to mint NFTs based on verified skills such as highly starred repos on github (React / ThirdWeb / Ethereum / Rails API)
