==================

Hi there, I'm Tyler. Previously I was a Founder Fellow at South Park Commons and before that I was a PM at Meta working on end-to-end encryption for Messenger and Instagram Direct. Before joining Meta I worked at Samsara where I led a new product in the manufacturing space. Prior to Samsara I was the founding Head of Product and also a GM at Workrise - a $3B workforce marketplace for industrial verticals.
