**Tyler Myracle**
==================

Hi there, I'm Tyler -- a product manager currently working and living in San Francisco. Most recently I worked at Samsara where I led a new product in the manufacturing space. Prior to Samsara I was the Head of Product and also a GM at RigUp in Austin, TX. I love working on early stage products with great teams. I have experience in B2B marketplaces, enterprise SaaS, on-demand platforms, and products at the intersection of hardware and software.   
  
  
**TL;DR**
---------

- 🕵️‍♂️ I'm looking for my next opportunity. Unfortunately I was affected by Samsara's layoffs in May 2020, so please get in touch if you're looking for a PM.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a cloud platform for manufacturers that harnesses the data found inside factory PLCs. I'm building it with the following stack:
  * Moxa UC-8200 series industrial linux computer as an edge gateway
  * Quectel EC25-A 4G/LTE modem and Twilio data plan for LTE connectivity
  * Rails backend in API mode
  * React frontend
  * Postgres database
  * TimescaleDB for time series sensor data
  * Ant design for UI components
  * Tailwind CSS for styling
- 🔨 I’m also building a checkout and passwordless auth proof of concept using the following tools:
  * Node/Express
  * React
  * SemanticUI for component library
  * Postgres
  * Docker
  * Stripe
